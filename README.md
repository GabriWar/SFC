# Finger Counter

## 🗒️ Overview
This Finger Counter is a simple Python project that uses computer vision and OpenCV to count fingers in real-time. It provides an easy-to-use solution for detecting and counting fingers through a webcam feed.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install the required libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python mediapipe 
     ```

2. **Usage:**
   - Run the `fingercounter.py` script.
   - Place your hand in front of the webcam.
   - The application will display the number of fingers detected.
   - it will also show the detected position of the index finger of the right hand (idk, maybe ill code a mouse with it later)

3. **Customization:**
   - Explore and modify parameters in the script to adjust detection sensitivity or add additional features.
